# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Predictor
A Chronic Kidney Disease Predictor have been made whose dataset have been taken from kaggle("https://www.kaggle.com/mansoordaku/ckdisease#kidney_disease.csv").

This file had null values and other data issues.
I have made two notebooks, DISEASE CLASSIFIER(dropped null values) is the one in which the null values have been dropped and the classification is done on the remaining dataset and the other DISEASE CLASSIFIER (modified) is the one where Data Manipulation have been done to replace null values using different methods.

Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers are used for classification in this model.
